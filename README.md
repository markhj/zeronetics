**Zeronetics** is an experimental 3D game engine developed mainly for educational
and learning purposes.

## ⚠️ Usage

> Warning: Do not use this engine for any type of production usage.

## 🌿 Features

**Decoupling and modularity** makes it easy to swap modules. For example, you
could replace the "out of the box"-OpenGL renderer with your own.

... That's about it for now 😐 This is, like, version ``0.1.x``.
