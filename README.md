**Zeronetics** is an experimental 3D game engine developed mainly for educational
and learning purpose.

## ⚠️ Usage

> Warning: Do not use this engine for production, or games you intend to ship.

## 🌿 Features

**Decoupling and modularity** makes it easy to swap modules. For example, you
could replace the "out of the box"-OpenGL renderer with your own.

... That's about it for now 😐 This is, like, version ``0.1.x``.

## 📜 Documentation

Documentation is available on
[GitHub Pages](https://markhj.github.io/zeronetics/).
