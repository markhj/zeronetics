## ðŸ”€ Management of allocation

As you've probably read in @ref render-manager, the renderer
is responsible for managing requests. In theory, this means the
renderer could just discard the requests, or do the exact
opposite of what's requested. _In theory_.

But on the other hand it gives renderers the ability to manage
allocation, de-allocation and updates in a way which is
performance-wise optimal for the specific renderer.
Keep in mind that
renderers don't work the same way, and we should make as few
assumptions about renderers as possible, and especially about
_how_ they work. The more assumptions we make, the harder it is
to implement a new renderer in a way where it performs to its
absolute best.

The renderer can process requests at a time when it sees fit,
and in the order it desires.

If the render manager had authority over the strategy,
then two render systems which work differently would
be forced to use identical strategies, making one or both
function in a suboptimal fashion.

To summarize, this decision is founded in a desire to provide
renderers with freedom and flexibility to manage allocation
in a way that's optimal for their specific implementation.
