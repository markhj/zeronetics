## How does Zeronetics work?

Zeronetics is a **code-first engine**, which means you first and
foremost _code_. You need to code C++ to build a game with Zeronetics.

The bundled editor is a tool you can use for _some_ tasks, but it can't
get you from A to Z. Mainly, it makes it easier to design and create levels
(or "scenes").

You must have experience with C++ to build a game with Zeronetics.
It's a big advantage if you're familiar with CMake, but you can get
by without.
