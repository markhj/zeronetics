**Zeronetics** is an experimental 3D game engine written in C++.
It was developed for educational and learning purposes.

If you're new, you probably want to head straight to the
@ref getting-started section.

If you have some experience with Zeronetics, and want to expand
your horizon, you can explore @ref tutorials and @ref manual.

If you're here to learn how to work on the engine itself (or a fork
of it), you'll find what you need under @ref arch and @ref dev.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
