# Welcome!

**Zeronetics** is an experimental 3D game engine written in C++.
It was developed for educational and learning purposes.

If you're new, you probably want to start out with the
@ref getting-started section.

If you're here to learn how to work on Zeronetics, you can
explore the @ref arch and @ref dev sections.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
