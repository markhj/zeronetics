@page settings Settings

The ZEN::Settings object assist with managing settings for 
window, video, audio, etc.

It does not concern itself directly with mapping of keys, etc.
because this is implemented by other classes in Zeronetics.

## ðŸ“º Generating the window

The ZEN::Window is generated with a set of settings. You
can modify them prior to generating, or re-generate when you see
fit (for instance, when the player clicks "Apply settings" or 
similar).

Example:

We initialize with a resolution of 800x600.

````cpp
ZEN::Settings settings {
    .screenResolution = {800, 600},
};

window.generate(settings);
````

@note Remember to 
@ref a-camera-aspect-ratio "update the camera's aspect ratio property"
when the monitor resolution changes.
