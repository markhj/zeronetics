@page orientation Orientation in the 3D space

This page deals with a range of definitions and clarifications in Zeronetics.

## ➡️ Forward

There is no universally accepted convention of what "**forward**" is in 3D game
worlds. Much like there's no definitive up and down in the universe.

In Zeronetics &mdash; when needed &mdash; "forward" is oriented such that
it _faces_ the positive Z-axis. This means that from the center ``(0, 0, 0)``
something that looks along the positive Z-axis is facing forward.

If you imagine a character which represents a human, the eyes will be looking
at the text "Forward" in the diagram above.
