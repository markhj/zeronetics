# Zeronetics project template

## Getting started

Make sure you have read how to
[set up and build the engine](https://markhj.github.io/zeronetics/install-engine.html)
in the documentation.

### CMake

To build your client application &mdash; the game &mdash; using CMake,
you need to define the environment variable ``ZERONETICS_DIR``,
such that CMake can find the Zeronetics engine.
Set the variable to the location where the Zeronetics engine is located.
