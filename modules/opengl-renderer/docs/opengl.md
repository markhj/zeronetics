Welcome to the documentation for the **OpenGL** implementation.

@note This documentation is not intended for basic game
development with Zeronetics. It's intended for the curious,
those who need more advanced approaches, and developers of Zeronetics
(or forks thereof).

@note This documentation only covers a few topics briefly, as it's
not the most relevant part to document, right now.
